# Terminology

---
## Some Terms that are Helpful to Know

- These terms will come up in the practice questions you’ll do today, in the course, and in economics in general.
1. Treatment variation
1. Exogenous
1. Endogenous
1. External validity

---
## Treatment Variation

- This term often comes up in empirical research that estimates causal effects.
- Treatment variation refers to the variation in X that you are using to identify the causal effect of X on Y.
- E.g., the variation in the timing and location of MDPs (as in GHM).
- E.g., the increase in police officer hiring that occurs before elections (this is the variation used in Levitt, 1997).
- E.g., the randomly-assigned change in police enforcement by location (as in Dur and Voolaard, 2019).

---
## Exogenous

- If a variation is exogenous, then it is not a function of other factors.
- It is not a function of other variable in the economic/statistical model.
- If something is exogenous, you can think of it being random.
- We ideally want to use treatment variation that is exogenous. 
- The gold standard would be randomization $\rightarrow$ randomized treatment (e.g., randomizing police) would be strictly exogenous since treatment status does not depend on anything.

---
## Endogenous

- The opposite of exogenous.
- More specifically, if something is endogenous, it means it is a function of (it depends on, it is endogenous to) something else.
- E.g., police allocation is endogenous to crime (unless we find some random or quasi-random variation to use).
- E.g., state adoption of tax incentives for the film industry may be endogenous to the size of the existing film industry (larger existing film industry = more likely to adopt an incentive)

---
## Endogenous vs. Exogenous

- The key question is how exogenous/endogenous the treatment variation is. 
- It’s not black and white where it is always clearly one or the other.
- Most treatment variation outside of an experiment lies on a spectrum between fully exogenous and strongly endogenous.
- There is no way to know or to test of treatment variation is endogenous.
- Determining how endogenous it is requires thinking critically about the factors that affect the treatment variation.
- For example, is there something non-random about the change in policing that is used in the paper? Could this non-randomness cause bias by creating a feedback loop (like the crime $\leftrightarrow$ police feedback loop shown earlier)?

# Issues in Causal Inference: Endogeneity

---
## Endogeneity in Crime Econ `r top_icon("question")`

.pull-left[
- Suppose you were to compare areas/cities with more police officers to areas/cities with fewer officers to see how crime differs. 
- Do the areas/cities with more officers have less crime?
- But the number of police officers is endogenous to crime.
- Endogenous since crime affects the number of police officers, but police officers affect crime.
- E.g., police officers allocated to high crime areas.
- Increases in crime prompt the hiring of additional officers.

- Do you think that by doing this comparison you would overestimate or underestimate the effect of police on reducing crime?

---
## Endogeneity in Crime Econ `r top_icon("question")`

.pull-left[
- Estimates would be negatively biased.
- Why?
- Since police are allocated to places with higher crime rates, or more police are deployed when crime increases, there is going to be a positive correlation between the two.
- Mistaking that for a causal relationship will bias the estimate.
- We have to break this endogeneity loop!

---
## Randomization

- We covered how Differece-in-Difference (DiD) can help us break the endogeneity loop.
- The ideal way to investigate the effect of police on crime would be to randomly allocate areas/cities with more/fewer police officers.
- Likely not possible…
- Is there a way that police are allocated that is “quasi-random”?
- Is there a natural experiment?
- Or, phrased another way, is there a way that police were allocated that was independent from the crime level (i.e. Is there a case where police officers were not allocated based on crime levels?)

---
## Empirical Studies on How Police Affect Crime

- In this course we will cover some neat empirical research articles that investigate how police affect crime using different experimental or “quasi-experimental” methods.

# The Contribution of Economist to the Study of Crime

---
## Key points in Marie (2014)

1. A .brand-blue[normative] framework for evaluating crime policy.
2. The application of sophisticated quantitative methods to analyze the causes of crime and the
effects of crime-control measures in this framework.
3. The conception of criminal behavior as individual choice, influenced by perceived
consequences.
4. The aggregation of individual choices into a systems framework for understanding crime
rates and patterns.


---
## Economists focus on policy


> Among the social sciences, economics tends to be best suited for addressing issues relevant to policy design. The economic model presumes that observed behaviour is not the inevitable result of underlying social conditions, but rather results from individual choices influenced by perceived consequences. If government policy can change those consequences, then behaviour change will follow.

---
## Economists focus on policy

- We went over one method in which economists try to infer causality of an intervention on an outcome---Million Dollar Plants.

- Economics can better focus on policy by studying causality.

- What is the effect of some factor (e.g., economic opportunity, police spending) on crime?

- The idea to go beyond just noticing correlations or associations, which, up until recently was more-so what those in sociology and psychology had done.

---
## Economics can help answer these questions in two ways

1. Economic (mathematical) models
  - The model comes up with predictions as to causal effects.
  - Pros: the conclusions are irrefutable if the model is correct.
  - Cons: the model could be incorrect (e.g., oversimplified)

2. Empirical methods (econometrics, data)
  - Uses data and actual policy events.
  - Either uses a randomized control trial or uses another methodology (e.g., difference-in-differences) to estimate a causal effect.

---
## Empirical methods (econometrics, data)

- Sometimes uses .blue[field experiments] (e.g., doing the randomization yourself, e.g., randomizing extra police presence)
- Often leverages so-called “.blue[natural experiments]” (a.k.a. quasi-experiments)
- The idea behind a .blue[natural experiment] is that there is something close to randomization happening without researcher intervention.
- E.g., studying the impacts of a welfare program on criminal activity, by leveraging the fact that funding was only available for people depending on what day and what time of day they called into the hotline (Palmer, Phillips, and Sullivan, 2019, which we cover later)
- E.g., you can argue that a policy or event was random, like in Tella and Schargrodsky (2004) who found that a random terrorist event led to an increase in police presence, and they leverage that to do a DiD (you will see more about this paper later)

---
## Empirical methods (econometrics, data)

- Pro: Observes real-life data and policy changes. The research is more “externally valid” compared to using models (e.g., models may not characterize actual behavior, which is complex).
- Pro: Since this approach often has economists estimating the causal effects of actual policies or events, it’s easier to comment on those events.
- Con: using real-life data is complicated, and it’s often difficult to control for all factors (although this is a difficulty with models, too)
- Con: The causal estimation strategy (e.g., DiD) requires assumptions that may not hold. E.g., the parallel trends assumption might not hold.

---
## Economics focuses on policy
- Given that both mathematical models and empirical (statistical) methods have pros and cons, it’s ideal to use both if possible.

- There has been more growth in empirical, data-driven research over models, likely due to:
   1. The increase in available data.
   2. Improvements in causal estimation techniques and statistical software.
   3. Stronger emphasis on studying actual events and actual human behavior.


---
## Cost-benefit analysis

- The economic approach to studying crime also brings with it cost-benefit analysis, which
balances the cost and benefits of policy actions.

- E.g., balance the benefits of reducing crime with the costs of reducing it.

- Cost-benefit analysis is frequently used by government to guide policy.

- Concepts like marginal costs come into play with cost-benefit analysis:

> “The optimal amount of crime is unlikely to be zero, since at some point the marginal costs of
additional prevention will exceed the marginal benefit of an additional reduction in crime.” (p.
8)

.blockquote[
  All models are wrong, but some are useful.

  - George Box
]

---
## The “Rational Criminal” Model

- A popular economic model of crime.

- Models choice between criminal vs non-criminal activity.

- Explains how criminal activity can be related to individual economic opportunities and to income inequality.

- This model is not supposed to explain all criminal behavior, but rather I am summarizing a simple version of this model so you have a sense of the types of models that economists often construct to explore how factors such as economic opportunity affect criminal behavior.

---
## The Simple Model

- Based on the work by Gary Becker and Edward Glaeser.

- Focuses on the occupational choice: criminal vs non-criminal.

- Suppose a city has $\overline{n}$ residents; where $n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots, \overline{n}$.

- Each resident can earn some income level from legitimate employment (non-criminal).

- For easy of exposition, we will sort people by increasing income.

- So if y is income, then Person 1 has the lowest income, and Person $\overline{n}$ has the highest income.

$$
y_1 < y_2 < \ldots < y_k < \ldots < y_n
$$

---
## Income for Each Individual

- So if y is income, then Person 1 has the lowest income, and Person $\overline{n}$ has the highest income.

$$
y_1 < y_2 < \ldots < y_k < \ldots < y_n
$$

- Called the legitimate-income curve.

- The value at $n = k$ gives the legitimate income for individual $k$.

```

]

---
## Criminal Activity – Overview

- The alternative to legitimate income is criminal activity.

- Individuals can instead steal from others.

- Four variables go into calculating the benefits/costs of criminal activity:

1. Value of loot (called $L$);
2. Probability of apprehension by police (called $a$);
3. Cost of Jail Time (called $J$ and $J$ is positive as it gets subtracted);
4. Stigma cost to being a criminal (called $e$).

---
## Criminal Activity – Set Up 

- The amount per period that individuals can steal is $L$ ( $L$ for “loot”).
- The value of $L$ is linked to the incomes of rich individuals.
- Criminals can be apprehended by police and lose their loot. Let the variable $a$ be the probability of apprehension. So $0 < a < 1$. 
  - 0 = never apprehended, 1 = always apprehended
- Apprehension also imposes the cost of a jail term. Let this be $J$.
- There is a stigma cost that criminals face regardless of if they are apprehended. This is $e$. 

---
## Criminal Activity - Value

1. If apprehended, the criminal has a benefit equal to $-J - e$ 
2. If they are not apprehended, the criminal has a benefit equal to $L - e$.

- Case (1) happens with probability $a$, so Case (2) happens with probability $1-a$.

- The expected value of the benefit (weighted average between both cases) is:

- Probability of Case 2 * Benefit of Case 2 + Probability of Case 1 * Benefit of Case 1

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Expected Value}&=\underbrace{(1 - a)L}_{\text{Value of crime if not caught}} – \underbrace{(1 – a)e}_{\text{Stigma cost if not caught}} + \underbrace{a(-J - e)}_{\text{Cost if jail and stigma if caught}} \\
&= (1 – a)L – e + ae –aJ -ae \\
\text{Expected Value}&= (1 – a)L – aJ - e
\end{align*}
$$

---
## Criminal Activity - Value

- Criminal income = $y_{crime} = (1 – a)L – aJ - e$

- If we assume that these variables $(L, J, a, e)$ are the same for everyone then criminal income is the same for everyone, regardless of their level of legitimate income.

- So the criminal income is a flat line at the value:

$$
Y = y_{crime} = (1 – a)L – aJ - e
$$

---
## Adding Criminal Income

.pull-left[

- The criminal income curve is a flat line at the value:

$$
Y = y_{crime} = (1 – a)L – aJ - e
$$

- Criminal and legitimate income is equal where $y_{crime} = y_c$ (intersection point).

- Individuals $c$ to $\overline{n}$ have $y_{crime} \leq y$. These individuals choose to be legitimate workers.

- Individuals 1 to $c$ have $y_{crime} \geq y$ These individuals choose to be criminals.

---
## City Characteristics and Crime

-Changing in exogenous variables will predict changes in crime rates.

$$
y_{crime} = (1 – a)L – aJ - e
$$

- So changes to $L$ (loot value), $J$ (jail cost), $a$ (probability of apprehension), and $e$ (social stigma) will affect criminal income.
- If $y_{crime}$ increases (decreases), the line shifts up (down) and more individuals switch from legitimate income to crime (crime to legitimate income).

- Increasing $L$ leads to an increase in $y_{crime}$. Better “loot” encourages crime.
- Increasing $J$ leads to a decrease in $y_{crime}$. So harsher punishments deter crime.
- Increasing $a$ leads to a decrease in $y_{crime}$. More police deters crime.
- Increasing $e$ leads to a decrease in $y_{crime}$. More social stigma to criminal activity deters crime.

## The Economy and Criminal Behavior

The economy could affect criminal behavior.

Consider two cases:

1. Income changes for the disadvantaged population (those with lower values for legitimate income);

2. Income changes for the advantaged population (those with higher values for legitimate income).

---
## Income Decrease for the Disadvantaged

.pull-left[

- If income for the disadvantaged decreases, the legitimate-income curve gets steeper.

- This curve intersects the criminal income line at higher value of n.

- More individuals rely on criminal rather than legitimate income.

- Effect is the opposite for an income increase.

# What do Economists Know About Crime?

---

## Overview of Economics Research

- Economists have devoted significant effort to determining to what extent the Becker model or crime (“rational criminal” model, from earlier) is empirical valid, and to what extent factors like policing, income levels, etc., affect crime rates.

- Much research examines deterrence – which factors could reduce crime. This literature focuses especially on arrest and incarceration rates, policing levels, and punishments like longer sentences or the death penalty.

- Other research done by economists studies the causal effects of crime related laws. I.e., can they isolate the actual effect of a law, beyond just a correlation? 

- Much of this work uses a difference-in-differences approach – comparing areas/people affected by a law change or event (e.g., change in state gun laws) to unaffected control group(s), before and after the law change or event. 

---
## Examples of This Work on the Causal Effect of Laws

1. Controversial and notable work on how abortion legalization affects crime rates.
2. Numerous studies on changes in gun laws, often at the state level.
  - .small[E.g., increased or decreased barriers to gun access or public holding, gun bans, and related legislation like “stand your ground” laws.]
3. Effects of lead exposure on crime (lots of work also in public health on lead).
4. Drug laws and drug prohibition.
  - .small[E.g., lots of recent work on state legalization of marijuana and how it affects numerous outcomes, ranging from crime to health.]

# Overview of Economics Research – Past Dills, Miron, and Summers (2010)

---
## There has been a lot of research on crime since Mirone, Dills, and Summers (2010)

- There has been much work on measuring racial bias in policing and criminal justice in various contexts. We will see this come up in the next briefing note on racial bias, and in some other content later in the course.

- There has also been better access to data since 2010. For example:
1. Crystal Yang, whose paper we will discuss later, leverages detailed sentencing data to study how economic circumstances affect recidivism (reoffending). (Yang, 2017)
2. Teams of economists have used administrative data (government-held data) in countries such as Norway that matches criminal justice records with other data like tax and program use data. They use this data and a “judge fixed effects” approach (discussed briefly in next slide, and later on in the course in more detail) to see how incarceration affects future criminal behavior. (Bhuller et al., 2020)

---
## Judge Fixed Effects

- The other “hot” area of research by economists right now uses an approach called “judge fixed effects”. 
- While we will get into this in more detail, here is a quick summary.
- The idea is to leverage the fact that many cases or situations in policing or criminal justice have random or conditional random assignment of judges/prosecuters/police to cases or incidents.

- Sometimes judges are randomized to cases, leading to key characteristics such as strictness or race, to be randomized to cases. 

- Or maybe it’s police officers (white vs. black) being randomly assigned to incidents involving white or black individuals.

- The idea is to exploit this “natural” randomization to see if it affects an outcome. This is usually better than difference-in-differences in getting us closer to a randomized control trial’s ability to estimate causal effects.

- This quasi-random assignment of cases to judges creates quasi-random variation that can be used to study the causal effect of a conviction (or other judicial decision) on causal outcomes (Bhuller et al., 2020; Eren and Mocan, 2021)

- Or random assignment to a judge/prosecutor of a particular race, to defendants, to study racial bias (Sloan, 2020)

]

---
## Other Examples of Judge---or Other Fixed Effects---Approaches

1. Random assignment of prosecutors (white vs. black) to cases of white vs. black defendants (Sloan, 2020).

2. Same as 1. but using bail judges (Arnold, Dobbie, and Yang, 2018)

3. Random assignment of police (white vs. black) to policing incidents that involve white vs. black people, and how this affects police use of force (Hoekstra and Sloan, 2020).

4. Random assignment of pickier judges (more likely to convict) to cases to see how this “random” variation in sentencing affects future criminal activity (Bhuller et al., 2020 using Norway data; Eren and Mocan, 2021, using Louisiana data).

# Applications of Judge Fixed Effects


---
## Endogenous Relationship Between Pre-Trial Detention and Case Outcome

We want to estimate the effect of pre-trial detention (\(D_i\)) on case outcome (\(Y_i\)). The naïve OLS model is:

$$
Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 D_i + X_i \gamma + \varepsilon_i
$$

where:
- $Y_i$ is the case outcome (e.g., conviction, sentence length),
- $D_i$ is an indicator for pre-trial detention,
- $X_i$ is a vector of control variables (e.g., defendant characteristics),
- $\varepsilon_i$ is the error term.

However, $D_i$ is endogenous because unobserved factors (e.g., case severity, defendant behavior) may influence both detention and outcome, leading to omitted variable bias:

$$
\mathbb{E}[\varepsilon_i | D_i] \neq 0
$$

---
## Using Judge Stringency as an Instrument (2SLS Approach)

To address endogeneity, we use an instrumental variable (IV): judge stringency (\(Z_i\)), which measures the propensity of a randomly assigned judge to detain defendants.

### First Stage:

$$
D_i = \pi_0 + \pi_1 Z_i + X_i \delta + \nu_i
$$

where:
- $Z_i$ is the instrument (e.g., judge's historical detention rate),
-  $\pi_1$ captures the relationship between judge stringency and detention,
-  $\nu_i$ is the first-stage error term.

---
## Using Judge Stringency as an Instrument (2SLS Approach) (cont.)

### Second Stage:

$$
Y_i = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 \hat{D}_i + X_i \theta + \eta_i
$$

where:
- $\hat{D}_i$ is the predicted probability of detention from the first stage,
- $\alpha_1$ is the causal effect of detention on case outcome.

For validity:
1. **Relevance**:  $Z_i$  strongly predicts  $D_i$  ($\pi_1 \neq 0$).
2. **Exogeneity**: $Z_i$ affects $Y_i$ only through $D_i$ and not through other channels.

## Homework for Next Class

### Find a crime paper with a dataset to use

#### I suggest finding papers from the American Economic Review since they tend to publish papers with data

### Use the code that I gave in the class as a reference

### Replicate the results of the paper

### Write a report with nice tables like the ones I presented in the class

### Work in groups of 5-8

### Understand the paper and the replication because you will present it in the another class afterward
